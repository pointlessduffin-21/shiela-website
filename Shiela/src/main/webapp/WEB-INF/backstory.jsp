			<h1><strong>A GIFT FROM DAD</strong></h1>
			<p>Shiela, the home server, was a gift from my dad almost 6 years ago.<br>Me and my dad started building the PC in a waiting lobby at my local SM Cebu.<br><br>Since then, Shiela has become the main driving force behind my work and projects.</p>

			<h1>machine designed for virtualization and networking</h1>
			<p>Shiela was the first machine I designed from the ground up <br>to handle virtualization and networking tasks. <br><br>It had the first 6-core consumer grade Intel CPU, the Core i7 8700K, and <br>a Z370 motherboard that had over four RAM slots and 7 PCIe slots for future expandability. <br><br>It was a machine designed for the future.</p>

			<h1>Hackintosh</h1>
			<p>Shiela was also the first machine I designed from the ground up <br>to natively work with macOS.<br><br>This was the case because before her, I considered getting a 21.5" iMac 4K <br>but it's asking price was ridiculously high for a desktop.<br><br>So we went with Shiela and since then, she has been the best alternative option <br>that could do everything I needed to.</p>
